## What is this?

Libmodule offers a small and simple C implementation of an actor library that aims to let developers easily create modular C projects in a way which is both simple and elegant.  
Indeed, libmodule was heavily inspired by my own actor library experience with [akka](https://akka.io/) for its API.  

## What is a module, anyway?

Unsurprisingly, module is the core concept of libmodule architecture.  
A module is an Actor that can listen on socket events too.  
Frankly speaking, it is denoted by a M_MOD() macro plus a bunch of mandatory callbacks, eg:
```C
#include <module/mod_easy.h>
#include <module/ctx.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

M_MOD("Pippo");

static bool m_mod_on_eval(mod_t *mod) {
    /* Should module be started? */
    return true;
}

static bool m_mod_on_start(mod_t *mod) {
    /* Register STDIN fd */
    m_mod_src_register(mod, STDIN_FILENO, 0, NULL);
    return true;
}

static void m_mod_on_stop(mod_t *mod) {
    
}

static void m_mod_on_evt(m_mod_t *mod, const m_queue_t *const evts) {
    m_itr_foreach(evts, {
        m_evt_t *msg = m_itr_get(m_itr);
        switch (msg->type) {
        case M_SRC_TYPE_FD: {
            char c;
            read(msg->fd_evt->fd, &c, sizeof(char));
            switch (tolower(c)) {
                case 'q':
                    m_mod_log(mod, "Leaving...\n");
                    m_mod_tell(mod, mod, "ByeBye", 0);
                    break;
                default:
                    if (c != ' ' && c != '\n') {
                        m_mod_log(mod, "Pressed '%c'\n", c);
                    }
                    break;
            }
            break;
        }
        case M_SRC_TYPE_PS:
            if (strcmp((char *)msg->ps_evt->data, "ByeBye") == 0) {
                m_mod_log("Bye\n"):
                m_ctx_quit(m_mod_ctx(mod), 0);
            }
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, a "Pippo" module is created and will echo chars from stdin until 'q' is pressed.  
Note that it does not even need a main function, as libmodule already provides a default one as a [weak, thus overridable, symbol](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.2/gcc/Function-Attributes.html).  

## Is it portable?

Yes, it is. Non-portable code is actually [compile-time-plugins](https://github.com/FedeDP/libmodule/tree/master/Lib/poll_plugins) based.  
On linux, libmodule's internal loop will use epoll, while on BSD and MacOS it will use kqueue.  
On other OS, cmake will fallback at looking for [libkqueue](https://github.com/mheily/libkqueue), a drop-in replacement for kqueue.  
Unfortunately, I am not able to test builds on other OS: I could only check that libmodule can be built on Linux through libkqueue.  

Finally, it heavily relies upon gcc attributes that may or may not be available for your compiler.

## Is there any documentation?

Yes, it is availabe at [readthedocs](http://libmodule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  
There are some simple examples too, see [Samples](https://github.com/FedeDP/libmodule/tree/master/Samples) folder.  
To see a real project using libmodule, see [Clight](https://github.com/FedeDP/Clight) and [Clightd](https://github.com/FedeDP/Clightd).

## CI

Libmodule, samples and tests builds are tested on [builds.sr.ht](https://builds.sr.ht/~fededp/libmodule) on archlinux, ubuntu, fedora and freebsd.  
Moreover, tests are executed and valgrind checked too.  

## But...why?

We all know OOP is not a solution to every problem and C is still a beautiful and much used language.  
Still, I admit to love code modularity that OOP enforces; moreover, I realized that I was using same code abstractions over and over in my C projects (both side projects and at my job).  
So I thought that writing a library to achieve those same abstractions in a cleaner and simpler way was the right thing to do and could help some other dev. 

## Build dep and how to build

You only need cmake to build libmodule on Linux and BSD/osx; it does not depend upon external software.  
On other platforms, you will need [libkqueue](https://github.com/mheily/libkqueue) too.  
To build, you only need to issue:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib ../
    $ make

*Note that libmodule can also be built as static library, by passing -DSTATIC_MODULE=true parameter to cmake.*

Installation - Generic OS
-------------------------

    # make install

Installation - Red Hat
----------------------

    $ cpack -G RPM

And finally install generated RPM package.

Installation - Debian
---------------------

    $ cpack -G DEB

And finally install generated DEB package.

Libmodule will install a pkg-config script too: use it to link libmodule in your projects, or use "-lmodule" linker flag.  
Please note that in order to test examples, there is no need to install the library.

For Archlinux users, Libmodule is available on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libmodule/).

## License
Libmodule is made available with a MIT license to encourage people to actually try it out and maybe use it inside their project, no matter if open or closed source.
