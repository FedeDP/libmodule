# Libmodule Samples

This folder contains some libmodule's examples.

## Building

To build these samples, pass "-DBUILD_SAMPLES=true" when building libmodule (from folder libmodule/build)

    $ cmake -DBUILD_SAMPLES=true ../

Then you'll find executables in Samples folder (eg: libmodule/build/Samples)
