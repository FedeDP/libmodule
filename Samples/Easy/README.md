# Easy Example

This example shows how to use libmodule's easy API.    
This is the simplest libmodule usage example, and it is pretty self-explanatory.  
Moreover, it runtime-loads another module, testModule.c (compiled as a shared object: testModule.so).  

Main() is missing as libmodule provides it as a weak symbol to be used with easy API.
